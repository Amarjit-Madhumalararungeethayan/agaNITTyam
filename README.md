Tamil is one of the world’s oldest and classical language known for its complexity and richness. The language has a long literary tradition and a wide variety of grammatical rules and exceptions. Tamil grammar is one of the most difficult subjects for students to grasp in school. There are a lot of questions that need to be understood, and there are also a lot of nuances. Conventional approaches, such as memorization and textbooks, might be restrictive and are unable to offer specific, dynamic answers to questions. 

This study suggests a revolutionary method for teaching school Tamil grammar by using a knowledge graph-based Quizzing portal. We want to give students a more efficient and interesting learning experience by utilizing knowledge graphs and templatized answer production, while having the ability to be up-scaled as per their need
